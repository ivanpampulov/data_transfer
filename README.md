# Automation of the data transfer between two excel tables

This program transfers information from a general template to import template for CRM. The process was done manually taking net time between 40 minutes and 120 min depending on the records in the export template.
With this automation tool the time was reduced to 5 minutes saving 5 sales people between 35 and 115 minutes leading to cost reduction and possibility to find new leads and close deals.

Project was developed in two phases. The first one using pyxl and the second using pandas.
Using pandas shortened the code length and gave better execution times.
